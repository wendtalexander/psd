Here I want to give a brief overview over the different methods one can use to calculate the power spectral density of a signal.


## 1. With FFT
The normal FFT method uses the `jax.numpy.fft.fft` method, where the singnal is
divided into segments, or the model is already simulated in a short segments.
From each of these segments the Fast Fouier Transformation is calculated.
Where the power spectral desity is caclulated with from the function $f(t)$

$$ P_{xx} = \lvert F(\omega)\rvert^2  dt $$
for each segment and summed over the different trials of the simulation.

## 2. With welch method
The welch method is based on the `jax.scipy.singal.welch` method, where multiple segments mulitplied with a window (hanning window) for less spectral leakage in high frequencies.
